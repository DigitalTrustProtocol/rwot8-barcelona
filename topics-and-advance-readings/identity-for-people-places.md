**Designing Identity For People & Places**
_The case for building an internet of proper nouns_


    “We all need a space online and offline that we can be ourselves freely, and not be
    impinged upon.”
        - Dr. Kyra Gaunt on Team Human, Ep.


Identity is a vital component of our lives, but the more our offline and online worlds merge the
more problematic identity becomes—vulnerable, fragmented, exposed; owned and controlled by
profit-motivated third parties. Self-Sovereign Identity promises a solution to these many
problems by way of protection, control and, as Christopher Allen puts it, healing the fractured
identity landscape by “reuniting identity with the ineffable ‘I’” of our natural selves.(1)


    “Privacy... can be understood as self-directed disclosure... Transparency, on the other
    hand, is socially pornographic and facilitates violence.(2)
    
Place-Identity states that all “​identities form in relation to environments.”(3) Most
“environments”—especially homes, formerly the ultimate bastions of privacy—are becoming
blanketed in connected devices and sensors, adding a layer of total and inescapable
transparency to our daily reality. We’re facing a near future where there are no spaces, whether
we’re alone or in public, where we are not observed, tracked or recorded. There can be no true
self-sovereignty in a world of secondary and tertiary data collection and correlation.


This paper will explore how we may architect a more complete individual sovereignty via privacy
and place identity as a person moves between private and public physical locations (home,
transit, work etc). ​ **By mapping our rights and reasonable expectations to privacy across**
**different contexts and comparing with the rights of devices in our spaces, we’ll seek to
outline systems of access and control that work in accordance with the rights and needs
of both sides.**

Questions to be explored:

- How do we define identity for place/physical location?
- What is the scale on which we can define a place identity? How is it applied across
    personal, shared and public spaces?
- What about unoccupied spaces? Does a place have identity outside of any relation to
    the people within it?
- What does identity for place/physical location entail, technologically speaking?
- How can we sufficiently protect people in private physical space in order to foster healthy
    identity development and interpersonal relationships?


We will seek to define some or all of the following:
- Capabilities: What will a place need to establish its own private, addressable identity?
- Ownership: ​How are place identities managed? By whom? Who can claim a place and
under which circumstances?
- Assurance: How will true privacy be established and confirmed?
- Access: How will access to private space be managed and mediated?
    - How will we create multi-layered systems for access and control that account for
different actors in a space with different rights and responsibilities (a home, a
school, a business, a city)?
- Attribution: What constitutes IP in regards to data from a mediated space (private,
shared, public)?
- Integration: How will third party devices be incorporated and managed on local
networks?

This paper will also use the home use case as a model for illustrating how place identity and
privacy systems may be incorporated to support self-sovereignty.


**Use Case - The Home**
The Castle Doctrine ​designates a person's abode or any legally occupied place (for example, a
vehicle) as a place in which that person has protections and immunities. To uphold these protections
in relation to data and surveillance, homes will need their own ​fog network/off-cloud gateways
operating as airlocks between private home space and commercial servers​. These locally
controlled networks will manage p​roper authorization and encryption for in-home devices and
other sensing/data-collecting technology.

Potential Additional Use Cases
- Public School
- City Port
