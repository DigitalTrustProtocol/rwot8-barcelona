# Exploring adoptation of VC sharing to provide value today

### by Snorre Lothar von Gohren Edwin

For the community to get faster adoptation of the standards we are working on now it is important to explore the the possibilities that can work out of the box, which is also safe enough to be trustworthy and not loose any sensitive data. 

With Verifiable Credentials it is important to ask the questiont what are we expecting the issuer, the holder, and / or the verifier to do? While still making it easily enough for all the users and keeping trustworthiness.

Sharing is what provides the end value for both the verifying and the sharing party. Hence if we are to provide value for the sharing party today, we have to ask the questions of where is this adopted, how can we make this adoption effortless by putting the work on the service providers? Is the user or another service expected to install software? If so install software where? Is that software domain-specific or integrated with some existing software?

We have to explore methods of trustworthy sharing with all these aspects in mind, can we do it without too much intrusion in the verifier side? If so we can be able to showcase the value of VC's in a real live example, very quickly.

# Situation
We have experienced with our users tests and pilots in East Africa that the same approach beeing taken by the community is not always feasible in these situations.

What is available to everybody today is sharing urls and physical sharing.
