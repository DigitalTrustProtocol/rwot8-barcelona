# Code Signing with DIDs
by Sean Gilligan

## Abstract
The topic paper [Blockchain-based Trust for Software Components](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/code-and-file-signing.adoc) was submitted at the 2015 RWOT workshop in San Francisco. It was not selected for group work at the conference. This topic paper proposes that this use case be reexamined in light of the progress that has been made on UDIDs and Verifiable Credentials.

## Proposal
* Review how UDID and Verificable Credentials can be used for creating an open, public registry of software components.
* Investigate use cases in open source development
* Investigate use cases in projects in dependency management
* Propose implememntation standards
* Prpopse any necessary extensions to the existing standards that might be required or useful.

## Requirements
* TBD.
